**[UNMAINTAINED] Just to be public, if someone is interested in the code **

The goal was to abstract common system related operations (sys admin tasks). It should report every step it took, so remote debugging was easy. And I wanted it to abstract different layers of operating tasks with best practices.

Didn't had enough time, so I'm publishing all of the work if someone wants to read / reuse the code.
